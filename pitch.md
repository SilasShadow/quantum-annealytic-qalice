Here’s a 5-minute pitch script you and your team can deliver. I’ve built it so that each of the five team members can take a section, keeping the flow engaging and emphasizing social impact, creativity, and ease of deployment — all tailored to a Vanguard context.

🎤 5-Minute Team Pitch: “Lattice – Smarter, Fairer Execution”
Speaker 1: Hook + Problem Context (1 min)

“Good afternoon. Imagine you’re a pension saver. You’ve worked hard your whole life, and your retirement savings depend not only on what you put in, but on how effectively your fund manager executes trades every single day. Even small inefficiencies in trading — paying a little more here, selling a little cheaper there — can cost retirees millions over time.

At Vanguard, where the mission is to give investors the best chance for investment success, execution efficiency is not just a technical problem — it’s a social problem. The less we waste on market impact, the more compounding works in favor of ordinary people’s savings. That’s where our solution comes in.”

Speaker 2: Product Introduction (1 min)

“We’ve built Lattice, an advanced execution optimization tool. It takes the daily challenge of splitting large trades across the market, and solves it with a mix of quantum-inspired optimization and classical risk-cost modeling.

Think of it as a GPS for trading volume: it reads the road map of intraday liquidity, considers traffic (market impact), weather (volatility), and your risk tolerance, and then plots the most efficient path to execute your trades.

Our creativity lies in how we combine:

Volume curve modeling that reflects real market liquidity.

Annealing algorithms (both simulated and quantum-inspired) to search vast solution spaces.

Constraints like POV caps and bin sizes to ensure results are practical, not academic.

The result is a system that doesn’t just minimize cost — it produces schedules that are smoother, fairer, and more consistent with Vanguard’s fiduciary duty to its investors.”

Speaker 3: Social Impact (1 min)

“Why does this matter socially?

First, lower execution costs mean higher returns for retirees and small investors. Vanguard’s scale means even a few basis points of efficiency can translate into billions saved for clients.

Second, smoother trading reduces market stress. Instead of creating sudden bursts of demand that can distort prices, our system encourages more stable, predictable flows. That improves liquidity for everyone, not just Vanguard.

And third, this approach democratizes cutting-edge research. We’re showing that quantum-inspired algorithms can serve everyday savers, not just exotic hedge funds. That’s creativity with a social purpose.”

Speaker 4: Deployment Practicality (1 min)

“This isn’t a moonshot — it’s deployment-ready. Our tool runs in Python, integrates with existing execution engines, and scales on cloud infrastructure that Vanguard already uses.

On the small side, it can run in milliseconds using simulated annealing on standard CPUs.

For larger, more complex runs, it can leverage GPUs or even cloud-based quantum annealers if desired.

It ingests the same data Vanguard already has: historical volume curves, order books, volatility estimates.

Ease of deployment is key. We don’t need to replace anything — just drop Lattice alongside existing code and compare its recommended schedules with current benchmarks.”

Speaker 5: Roadmap + Close (1 min)

“Our timeline to implementation is simple:

Week 1–2: Pilot with one Vanguard trading desk using simulated annealing only.

Month 1: Scale to multiple asset classes, integrate dashboards to visualize cost savings and smoother execution paths.

Month 2–3: Deploy optional quantum-inspired back-end, benchmark against live execution results.

Month 6: Full integration into Vanguard’s execution stack, with reporting on realized savings passed directly back to investors.

In short: within weeks, this can be in traders’ hands; within months, it can be embedded into Vanguard’s infrastructure, amplifying the mission of low-cost, high-impact investing.

So — Lattice is more than an algorithm. It’s a tool that turns cutting-edge science into social good: protecting the retirement of millions, making markets fairer, and showing how Vanguard continues to lead in innovation. Thank you.”
